# June 4th: Starting and ending the project!

I took inspiration from the hackclub jam on PCB hacker cards and made my own. I thought it would be fun if when some one brings their phone near to the NFC, my name lights up. So I added an led in the center of each letter of my first name. Then I proceded to write down contact methods for me and my github. Finally to add the finishing touch and really make it cool, I utilized JLCPCB's multicolor silkscreen and I added the images of The Starry Night, The Great Wave off Kanagawa, and The Mona Lisa. My hacker card looks really cool and I hope it arrives in time for undercity so I can show it to everyone!
